# Maze

Maze is a SwiftUI project that generates and solves mazes using various algorithms. This project is currently in development.

## Features

- Generate mazes using different algorithms (e.g. Recursive Backtracker, Prim's Algorithm)
- Solve mazes using different algorithms (e.g. Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search)
- Visualize the maze generation and solving process

## Requirements

- Xcode 15.0 or later
- Swift 5.5 or later
- iOS 15.0 or later
- Make (optional, for running the project from the command line)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antinlay/Maze.git
```

2. Open the project in Xcode:

```bash
cd Maze
open Maze.xcodeproj
```

Alternatively, you can run the project from the command line using Make:

```bash
cd Maze
make run
```

This will build and run the project on a simulator.

## Usage

- Select a maze generation algorithm from the settings.
- Generate a maze.
- Select a maze solving algorithm from the settings.
- Solve the maze.
- Observe the visualization of the maze generation and solving process.
